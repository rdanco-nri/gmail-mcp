 * separator), NUL bytes, and reserved Windows characters (`: * ? " < > |`)
 * as-is, all of which are hostile once the filename is passed to
 * `path.resolve` or the filesystem.
 *
 * Policy (matches the `ATTACHMENT_HOSTILE_CHARS` regex below):
 * - Replace each hostile character (POSIX separator `/`, Windows
 *   separator `\`, NUL / C0 / DEL / C1 control chars, Windows reserved
 *   `: * ? " < > |`) with `_`. The substitution is 1:1 — repeated
 *   hostile chars are NOT collapsed, so `//` becomes `__` (two
 *   underscores), not a single `_`.
 * - Strip only leading dots (`^\.+`). Dots in the middle of the name
 *   are preserved, so `foo.bar.pdf` stays as-is.
 * - Fallback to `"attachment"` when the normalised result is either
 *   empty OR consists entirely of `_` characters — the latter covers
 *   inputs that were nothing but hostile chars (e.g. `////` → `____`).
 *
 * Worked example: `..\..\etc\passwd` → replace-hostile →
 * `.._.._etc_passwd` → strip-leading-dots → `_.._etc_passwd`. Repeated
 * separators are NOT collapsed; the only removal is the leading `..`.
 *
 * This helper shapes the leaf filename only — it is NOT the
 * anti-path-traversal gate. The gate is downstream in `src/index.ts`:
 * `path.resolve(savePath, filename)` followed by a
 * `startsWith(savePath + path.sep)` containment check, plus the
 * `safeWriteFile` open-with-O_NOFOLLOW/O_EXCL pattern.
 *
 * Idempotent. Unicode characters outside the hostile set (accents,
 * emojis, CJK) pass through untouched — intentional so a user
 * downloading `résumé.pdf` sees `résumé.pdf` on disk, not `r_sum_.pdf`.
