/**
 * Tool-handler middleware for the MCP `CallToolRequestSchema` dispatcher.
 *
 * This module exists to extract the rate-limit + audit-log wiring that
 * currently lives inline inside the 1300-line switch in `src/index.ts`,
 * mirroring the design of the sibling repos:
 *   - `mercury-invoicing-mcp/src/middleware.ts:359`
 *   - `faxdrop-mcp/src/middleware.ts:203`
 *
 * Extraction unblocks the v0.10.0 parity layers (`AbortSignal.timeout`,
 * `sanitizeForLlm` fence, dry-run, `structuredContent`) without having
 * to duplicate glue code in every switch case.
 *
 * NOTE: this first release ships the module as an importable helper
 * with unit tests; the switch in `src/index.ts` is migrated in a
 * follow-up PR so the wire-up can be reviewed as a separate, contained
 * change on top of an already-merged, tested helper.

 * Tool names that mutate Gmail state (outbound mail, label / filter /

 * call is made; read-only tools (`list_*`, `get_*`, `read_*`,
 * `search_*`, `download_*`) bypass dry-run entirely — there is nothing
 * to preview, and `download_*` only writes to a local jail inside
 * `GMAIL_MCP_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, which is an LLM-visible side effect that
 * the download-path hardening (see `src/index.ts`) owns rather than
 * the dry-run gate (CR #52).
 *
 * Keep in sync with the rate-limit buckets in `src/rate-limit.ts` —
 * every tool listed here should have a rate-limit entry, and vice
 * versa. The two lists are the canonical "this is a write operation"
 * signal used across the stack.

 *      MCP payload with the `mcp_rate_limit_*` error-type so a client
 *      can distinguish a local MCP safeguard from a Gmail-side 429.
 *   2. `handler()` runs. Any throw is re-thrown — the caller owns the
 *      error-mapping surface (today: the outer try/catch in
 *      `setRequestHandler`; tomorrow: a Gmail-error-to-ToolResult
 *      mapper layered on top).
 *   3. `logAudit(name, args, result)` fires in the `finally`, with
 *      `result` = `"ok"` on a clean return, `"error"` on a throw, or
 *      `"rate_limited"` if the rate-limit branch returned early.
 *
 * This matches the three terminal audit-log states already emitted
 * inline by `src/index.ts` at lines 526 (`rate_limited`), 1948 (`ok` /
 * `error` from the finally), so the observable audit trail is
 * unchanged once the wire-up PR lands.
